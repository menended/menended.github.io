          What is true is that amid the gloomy darkness of a troubled world, the
          light of Jesus Christ shines ever brighter. He can speak truth to our
          hearts and minds as we seek Him and learn to hear Him.

        <p>
          As our Heavenly Father loves us, we also should love His children. May
          we be models of kindness. May we ever live up to the words of the
          Savior: “By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye
          have love one to another.

        <p>
          We commit to follow Him. May that be a day that recurs over and over
          again throughout our lives. I leave you my testimony and blessing that
          as we “behold the man,” we will find meaning, joy, and peace in this
          earthly life and eternal life in the world to come.

          God keeps his promises
        </h4>
        <p>
          Having been on mission I realized that the Lord keeps his promises to
          provide and care for those who preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ. I
          had the opportunity to experience it as a missionary in Honduras.

          His promises about tithing
        </h4>
        <p>
          I have repeatedly tested the promise of tithing. In different
          circumstances of my life we had many deficiencies. Despite that, we
          never lacked food. He does not abandon us if we comply with this law.

          Whenever I fast I

          listen to our prayers, miracles ocurr for you and others that migth be
          arround you. I share this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

        <p>
          At different times in the Savior’s life, He took opportunities to be
          alone to ponder and pray. I invite you to spend some time in the next
          few days to be alone in a quiet place to commune with your Heavenly
          Father. #HearHim

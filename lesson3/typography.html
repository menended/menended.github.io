        <h2>Aligment</h2>
        <img src="images/aligment.jpg" alt="Aligment Example" class="picture">
        <h3><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools</a></h3>
        <p>This principle is one of the most important ones to take care of. It is usually ignored but it does a huge impact. It is prefered a left aligment than a centered one, this is why I chose w3schools as example. They have a great left aligment and space between the subjects that makes it visually appealing and works great with mobile browsers.

        <h2>White Space</h2>
        <img src="images/white-space.jpg" alt="White Space Example" class="picture">
        <h3><a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple</a></h3>
        <p>Apple has been making a great work with white space all over the years and this is why I chose this example. As we know, it is not just white space, it is a breathing space for all elements including fonts.</p>
        <p>We can appreciate how even the shadows has a little gap between them and how simplicity looks more sophisticated than any other kind of designs.</p>

        <h2>Contrast</h2>
        <img src="images/contrast.jpg" alt="Contrast Example" class="picture">
        <h3><a href="https://www.britannica.com/">Britannica</a></h3>
        <p>I like how the contrast in this webpage makes it look professional but visually apealling at the same time. We can even see some repetition, aligment and space. I wouldn't bother at all to use it instead of an application, and if I desire to, I can create a shorcut from this webpage to use it and save some space in my phone.</p>

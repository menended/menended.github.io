        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          The audience we want to reach are older people and young. The first ones will be those who need a quick information regarding the current weather to know if they can do some errands that day, go to the park, or visit their family. The second ones are those young people who usually enjoy nature and would like to hike a mountain, go for a good ride or enjoy of a good workout outside.

        <p class="blog-p">
          What an incredible season we have had. We celebrated our 50th year of
          running trips down the Grand Canyon. This year we ran 36 trips down the
          Grand Canyon introducing over 800 people to one of our favorite places
          on earth. We trained 4 new guides and welcomed them to our family. The
          season started off with some chilly weather in the early season, but our
          guests braved the cold and loved every minute of their trip (show
          pictures). Later the temperatures soared reaching highs of 120 F in Utah and 95 on the Arizona. We didn't have any trouble getting
          people in the water at those temperatures.

        <p class="blog-p">
          Our trips are all run in some of the most remote areas of the United
          States. We share these areas with lots of critters both large and small.
          Here are some tips on what to do if you should find yourself face to
          face with one. Scorpions: There are hundreds of varieties of scorpions,
          most of them being harmless. There are, however, a handful of them that
          can be dangerous and even potentially lethal. Scorpions can be found in
          almost every ecosystem and are very adaptable to their environment. The
          scorpion that calls Phantom Ranch in the Grand Canyon home is the Bark
          Scorpion, the most venomous in the United States. Do not worry though,
          the bark scorpions are only lethal to their prey and luckily humans are
          not on that list! They spend the day hiding and crawl out at night to
          hunt. They will eat crickets, moths, spiders and other insects. Many
          compare their sting to an intense bee sting. Relief can be found with
          ice, aspirin and time. When in the canyon, pay attention to where you
          are walking at night. Always wear your shoes or sandals. Always have a
          light with you to see where you are going. Never try to capture a
          scorpion and if you get stung, see your guide immediately. Big horn
          sheep: For many people, bighorn sheep symbolize the rugged mountain
          west. It is one of two species of wild sheep in North America. It’s
          compact body is muscular with chocolate brown fur. Most weigh 160-250
          lbs. They have exceptional vision, hearing and smell that helps them
          detect and avoid predators. Their large curved horns can weigh up to 30
          lbs. Females also have horns but they are short with a slight curvature.
          Horns are used as tools for eating and fighting. If you encounter a big
          horn sheep, don’t agitate it. The park service asks that you stay 100
          feet away from big game animals. Leave them enough room for escape if
          they feel threatened.

      Hello, this is where I was born, Guatemala City. When Elder Christopherson
      came once he said: "Some call this land the Eternal Spring" and it is
      indeed.

      I am deeply grateful to be here, I have been a member of the Church since
      I was born and I love this Churh and the One who stands at the head. I started to pursue a bachelor's degree in Applied Technology. Several
      times I was interested in learning programming, and I am really excited that
      I finally started this path. It is a pleasure to meet you all!
